    <pre>

    This is a Car club that is based in Calgary, 
    And is a community that people that share interest 
    in automotive vehicles and other motor vehicles.
            

    Our club is always open to questions and feedback 
    about our cars, and always open to new members,
    as we don't have a members cap. We also don't have 
    vehicles requirements for joining.


    Feel free to contact us in our contacts page and 
    we will respond to any questions you may have.
